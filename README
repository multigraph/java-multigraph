	multigraph.xsd
	    MUGL schema definition file

	graph.xml
	graph2.xml
	graph3.xml
	    Sample MUGL files

        doc

SETUP

    After cloning this project from git, you need to also clone the 'mugl-schema' project into it, as follows:

        1. cd into the top level directory of this project (the directory containing this README file)
        2. % git clone git.nemac.org:/usr/local/git-repos/mugl-schema.git
           OR
           % git clone http://git.nemac.org:/mugl-schema.git
        3. % cd mugl-schema
        4. % checkout java-multigraph

BUILDING

    Execute 'ant'.

    To generate the javadocs, execute 'ant javadoc'.  The output will be placed in the 'doc/javadoc' directory (which
    will be created if it does not exist.)

RUNNING

    'ant graph2'   (runs the org.multigraph.UITest program on the file 'graph2.xml')
    'ant graph3'   (runs the org.multigraph.UITest program on the file 'graph3.xml')
    'ant graph'    (runs the org.multigraph.UITest program on the file 'graph.xml'; this one currently does not work)
