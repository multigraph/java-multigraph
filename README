This directory contains the Java Multigraph project.

    src
	Contains the Java source code

    build.xml
	Ant build file

    ant-lib
	Contains JAXB-related jar files needed to allow ant to run jaxb (specifically, the 'xjc' task)

    multigraph.xsd
	MUGL schema definition file

    graph.xml
    graph2.xml
    graph3.xml
	Sample MUGL files

To build, just run 'ant'.

To run, execute one of:

    'ant graph2'   (runs the org.multigraph.UITest program on the file 'graph2.xml')
    'ant graph3'   (runs the org.multigraph.UITest program on the file 'graph3.xml')
    'ant graph'    (runs the org.multigraph.UITest program on the file 'graph.xml'; this one currently does not work)
